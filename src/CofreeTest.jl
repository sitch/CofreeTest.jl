    CofreeTest

Cofree testing — parallel, observable, beautifully formatted.

A categorical-grade test framework for Julia. Tests are modeled as cofree
comonads with parallel execution, real-time event streaming, and a rich
terminal UI.

The parallel execution architecture (process-based worker pools, historical
duration scheduling, RSS-based worker recycling) is adapted from
[ParallelTestRunner.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTesting/ParallelTestRunner.jl)
by @maleadt and contributors, originally built for CUDA.jl.
